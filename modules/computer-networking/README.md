# Computer Networking

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Overview
Understanding how networked systems communicate, from physical transmission to application protocols. Covers the Internet architecture, TCP/IP, routing, network security, and protocols that enable modern distributed applications.

## Prerequisites
**Required:**
- Programming - Ability to work with network APIs and protocols

**Recommended:**
- Operating Systems - Understanding of system-level concepts helps with network programming
- Computer Architecture - Understanding of hardware/software interaction

## Programming Languages
- **C** (Intermediate) - Socket programming and low-level network operations
- **Python** (Beginner to Intermediate) - Network scripting and protocol implementation
- **Any modern language** - Network concepts apply across languages

## Recommended Resources

### Textbooks
- **Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach** by James Kurose and Keith Ross (8th Edition)
  - Excellent pedagogical approach starting from application layer
  - Clear explanations with practical examples
  - Well-regarded as the best introductory networking text
  - Level: Intermediate
  - ISBN: 978-0135928615

### Video Lectures

#### Stanford CS 144 - Introduction to Computer Networking
- **Institution:** Stanford University
- **Platform:** Stanford course site
- **Description:** Comprehensive networking course covering protocols, Internet architecture, and implementation
- **Modern, well-structured lectures**

### Online Resources
