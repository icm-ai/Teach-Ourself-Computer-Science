# Languages and Compilers

## Overview
Understanding how programming languages work and how compilers translate high-level code to machine instructions. Covers language design, parsing, semantic analysis, optimization, and code generation. Learning compilers provides deeper insight into language features and enables writing better code.

## Prerequisites
**Required:**
- Programming - Strong programming fundamentals essential
- Algorithms and Data Structures - Compilers use graphs, trees, and other data structures

**Recommended:**
- Computer Architecture - Understanding target machine architecture aids code generation study

## Programming Languages
- **Any modern language** (Intermediate) - Crafting Interpreters uses Java then C; concepts apply universally
- **Language of choice** - Implementing an interpreter/compiler is the primary learning activity

## Recommended Resources

### Textbooks
- **Crafting Interpreters** by Bob Nystrom
  - Modern, highly readable introduction to interpreters and compilers
  - Build two complete interpreters from scratch
  - Entertaining writing style with excellent pedagogy
  - Level: Beginner to Intermediate
  - [Available online](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

- **Compilers: Principles, Techniques & Tools** (Dragon Book) by Aho, Lam, Sethi, and Ullman
  - Comprehensive reference text
  - Dense and formal; cherry-pick topics with guidance
  - Level: Intermediate to Advanced
  - Use as supplementary reference after Crafting Interpreters

### Video Lectures
