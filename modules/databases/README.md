# Databases

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Overview
Understanding how database systems store, retrieve, and manage data efficiently. Covers relational database theory, SQL, transaction processing, query optimization, database internals, and data modeling principles.

## Prerequisites
**Required:**
- Programming - Ability to write database queries and applications

**Recommended:**
- Algorithms and Data Structures - Database internals use sophisticated data structures (B-trees, hash tables)
- Operating Systems - Understanding of storage systems and concurrency

## Programming Languages
- **SQL** (Intermediate) - Essential for relational database interaction
- **Any modern language** (Intermediate) - For database application development and ORM usage

## Recommended Resources

### Textbooks
- **Readings in Database Systems** (Red Book) by Peter Bailis, Joe Hellerstein, and Michael Stonebraker
  - Collection of seminal papers in database systems
  - Best for intermediate learners after foundational course
  - Level: Intermediate to Advanced
  - [Available online](http://www.redbook.io/)

- **Database Management Systems** by Raghu Ramakrishnan and Johannes Gehrke
  - Comprehensive introductory textbook
  - Level: Intermediate
  - Use if a traditional textbook approach is preferred

- **Data and Reality** by William Kent
  - Timeless perspective on data modeling
  - Short, philosophical treatment of how to model information
