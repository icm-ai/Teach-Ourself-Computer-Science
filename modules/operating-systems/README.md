# Operating Systems

## Overview
Understanding how operating systems manage hardware resources, provide abstractions for programs, and enable concurrent execution. Covers processes, threads, scheduling, memory management, file systems, and system-level programming.

## Prerequisites
**Required:**
- Computer Architecture - Understanding CPU and memory operation is essential for OS concepts
- Programming - Strong programming skills, especially in low-level languages

**Recommended:**
- Algorithms and Data Structures - Many OS components use sophisticated data structures

## Programming Languages
- **C** (Intermediate to Advanced) - Operating systems are typically implemented in C; understanding OS internals requires C proficiency
- **Assembly** (Beginner) - Helpful for understanding system calls and context switching

## Recommended Resources

### Textbooks
- **Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces** by Remzi and Andrea Arpaci-Dusseau
  - Modern, readable treatment of OS concepts
  - Structure divided into three conceptual pieces: virtualization, concurrency, persistence
  - Excellent writing and exercises
  - Level: Intermediate
  - [Available online](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/)

- **Operating System Concepts** (Dinosaur Book) by Silberschatz, Galvin, and Gagne
  - Comprehensive reference, though criticized for readability
  - Level: Intermediate
  - Use as supplementary reference if needed

### Video Lectures

#### Berkeley CS 162 - Operating Systems
- **Institution:** UC Berkeley
- **Platform:** Berkeley course site / YouTube
- **URL:** [Course site](https://cs162.org/)
- **Description:** Comprehensive OS course covering processes, threads, synchronization, memory management, file systems
- **Pairs well with OSTEP textbook**

### Online Resources
- [OSTEP Homework](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/Homework/homework.html) - Simulation exercises and projects
- [xv6 Operating System](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2021/xv6.html) - Simple Unix-like OS for study and modification

## Exercises

### Practice Problems
- **Source:** OSTEP homework and projects
- **Difficulty:** Intermediate to Advanced
- **Estimated time:** 100-200 hours
- **Topics:** Process scheduling, concurrency, memory management, file systems

- **Source:** xv6 labs
- **Difficulty:** Advanced
