# Mathematics for Computer Science

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Overview
Discrete mathematics and mathematical foundations for computer science. Covers logic, combinatorics, probability, set theory, graph theory, and number theory as they apply to computing. Provides the mathematical maturity needed for rigorous algorithm analysis and theoretical computer science.

## Prerequisites
**Required:**
- High school mathematics (algebra, basic calculus helpful but not required)

**Recommended:**
- Programming - Seeing mathematical concepts applied in code provides valuable context

## Programming Languages
No specific programming language required for theoretical study. Mathematical concepts can be explored computationally in any language (Python, Scheme, or others are useful for exploration).
