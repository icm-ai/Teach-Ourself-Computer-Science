# Programming

## Overview
Foundational programming concepts and computational thinking. This module covers essential programming paradigms, recursion, abstraction, and program design principles that form the basis for all computer science study.

## Prerequisites
None. This is a foundational subject suitable for beginners.

Note: This guide assumes basic programming familiarity. For complete beginners, additional introductory resources may be needed before starting.

## Programming Languages
- **Scheme/Racket** (Beginner to Intermediate) - Functional programming emphasis; used in SICP for teaching fundamental concepts
- **Python** (Beginner to Intermediate) - Alternative approach via Composing Programs; practical for immediate application

## Recommended Resources

### Textbooks
- **Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs** by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman
  - Classic text covering functional programming, recursion, abstraction, and computational models
  - Recommended: Chapters 1-3 at minimum
  - Level: Intermediate
  - [Available online](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html)

- **Composing Programs** by John DeNero
  - Python-based adaptation in the tradition of SICP
  - Modern alternative for those preferring Python
