# Distributed Systems

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Overview
Understanding how to design and reason about systems that run across multiple machines. Covers consistency, fault tolerance, replication, distributed consensus, and the trade-offs inherent in distributed system design. Essential knowledge for modern cloud-based and scalable applications.

## Prerequisites
**Required:**
- Computer Networking - Understanding network communication is fundamental
- Operating Systems - Concurrency and system-level concepts apply to distributed systems

**Recommended:**
- Databases - Many distributed systems concepts overlap with distributed databases
- Algorithms and Data Structures - Distributed algorithms build on fundamental algorithmic concepts

## Programming Languages
- **Any modern language** (Intermediate) - Go, Java, Python, or others are suitable for implementing distributed systems
- Focus on understanding distributed system concepts rather than language specifics

## Recommended Resources

### Textbooks
- **Designing Data-Intensive Applications** by Martin Kleppmann
  - Highly readable, practitioner-oriented treatment
  - Covers replication, partitioning, transactions, consistency, and distributed data systems
  - Best modern introduction to distributed systems
  - Level: Intermediate
  - ISBN: 978-1449373320

- **Distributed Systems** by Maarten van Steen and Andrew Tanenbaum (3rd Edition)
  - Traditional textbook approach
  - More formal than DDIA
