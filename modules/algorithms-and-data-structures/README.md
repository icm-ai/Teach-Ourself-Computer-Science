# Algorithms and Data Structures

[English](README.md) | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

## Overview
Essential algorithms and data structures that form the foundation of efficient problem-solving in computer science. Covers complexity analysis, sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming, and fundamental data structures.

## Prerequisites
**Required:**
- Programming - Strong programming fundamentals needed to implement and analyze algorithms

**Recommended:**
- Mathematics for CS - Mathematical maturity helps with complexity analysis and proofs

## Programming Languages
- **Any modern language** (Intermediate) - Algorithms can be implemented in C, Java, Python, etc.
- Focus on understanding concepts rather than language-specific syntax

## Recommended Resources

### Textbooks
- **The Algorithm Design Manual** by Steven Skiena (3rd Edition)
  - Practical approach to algorithmic problem-solving
  - War stories demonstrate real-world applications
  - Excellent balance of theory and practice
  - Level: Intermediate
  - ISBN: 978-3030542559

- **Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS)** by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein
  - Comprehensive reference text
  - More proof-heavy than Skiena
  - Level: Intermediate to Advanced
  - Use selectively as reference material
