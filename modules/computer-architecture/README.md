# Computer Architecture

## Overview
Understanding how computers work at the hardware level, from logic gates to processor design. This module covers computer systems, memory hierarchy, processor architecture, and the relationship between hardware and software.

## Prerequisites
**Recommended:**
- Programming - Understanding of basic programming concepts helps contextualize how software interacts with hardware

## Programming Languages
- **C** (Intermediate) - Low-level programming for understanding memory management and hardware interaction
- **Assembly** (Beginner) - Understanding of assembly language for processor-level operations
- **HDL (Hardware Description Language)** (Beginner) - For Nand2Tetris hardware simulation

## Recommended Resources
