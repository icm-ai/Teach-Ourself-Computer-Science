# Teach Yourself Computer Science

English | [简体中文](README_CN.md)

Personal learning repository for systematically studying computer science fundamentals based on the [Teach Yourself Computer Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com) curriculum.

## Overview

This repository organizes learning materials across 9 core computer science subjects. Each module provides structured guidance including prerequisites, recommended resources, and practice exercises.

## Learning Modules

### 1. [Programming](modules/programming/)
Foundational programming concepts, recursion, abstraction, and computational thinking.

**Key Resources:** Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP), Brian Harvey's CS 61A

### 2. [Computer Architecture](modules/computer-architecture/)
Understanding computer systems from logic gates to processor design.

**Key Resources:** Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, Nand2Tetris

### 3. [Algorithms and Data Structures](modules/algorithms-and-data-structures/)
Essential algorithms, data structures, and complexity analysis for efficient problem-solving.

**Key Resources:** The Algorithm Design Manual by Steven Skiena, LeetCode practice

### 4. [Mathematics for Computer Science](modules/mathematics-for-cs/)
Discrete mathematics foundations including logic, combinatorics, probability, and graph theory.

**Key Resources:** MIT Mathematics for Computer Science, MIT 6.042J lectures

### 5. [Operating Systems](modules/operating-systems/)
How operating systems manage resources, processes, memory, and file systems.

**Key Resources:** Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces, Berkeley CS 162

### 6. [Computer Networking](modules/computer-networking/)
Internet architecture, protocols, and networked system communication.

**Key Resources:** Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach, Stanford CS 144

### 7. [Databases](modules/databases/)
Database systems, SQL, transaction processing, and data modeling.

**Key Resources:** Readings in Database Systems (Red Book), Berkeley CS 186

### 8. [Languages and Compilers](modules/languages-and-compilers/)
Programming language design, parsing, and compiler implementation.

**Key Resources:** Crafting Interpreters, Alex Aiken's Compilers Course

### 9. [Distributed Systems](modules/distributed-systems/)
Designing fault-tolerant systems across multiple machines.

**Key Resources:** Designing Data-Intensive Applications, MIT 6.824

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Start with Prerequisites:** Review each module's prerequisites before beginning
2. **Follow Your Path:** Subjects can be studied in various orders, though suggested sequencing is:
   - Begin with Programming and Mathematics for CS
   - Computer Architecture before Operating Systems
   - Networking and Operating Systems before Distributed Systems
3. **Add Resources:** Place learning materials in appropriate `resources/` subdirectories
4. **Track Progress:** Use module checklists to monitor completion
5. **Take Notes:** Each module README includes space for personal study notes

## Learning Approach

**Estimated Time:** 100-200 hours per subject for thorough understanding

**Study Strategy:**
- Combine textbook reading with video lectures for reinforcement
- Complete practice exercises and projects for each subject
- Revisit favorite topics throughout career for deeper mastery
